# Aquaponics
Code base for an aquaponics system

# Description
Dragonfly is a simple data collection service for arduino-like 
sensors. It comes with a server and front end to view gathered 
data as well as a sample .ino file.

# Getting Started 
git clone into your preferred directory.
upload sample arudino code. 
cd into dragonfly/static
npm install
cd into dradonfly
python run.py
In another terminal window
python run.py serialPoller
Navigate to http://localhost:8000
You should see at least the basis of dragonfly. As the poller
collects more data, the site will fill itself out.
Enjoy!
